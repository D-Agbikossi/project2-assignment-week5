# Data Structures & Algorithms Project – Week 5

## Project Overview

This project contains five independent C programs, each solving a different real-world inspired problem using classic data structures and algorithms:

- **Question 1** – Max-Heap based job scheduler in a cloud environment  
- **Question 2** – Max-Heap of passengers for smart airport security  
- **Question 3** – Kruskal’s algorithm for a fiber-optic Minimum Spanning Tree  
- **Question 4** – BFS-based communication graph analysis for a cyber incident  
- **Question 5** – Bellman–Ford shortest paths for a banking transaction network

Each question is implemented in its own subfolder with a modular structure (`.h`/`.c` files) and a dedicated `README.md` explaining details and usage.

## Compilation

All code is written in standard C and can be compiled with `gcc` from within each question’s folder.

## Execution

After compiling, run the executables from within their respective folders.

Each program will prompt for the necessary input (arrays, adjacency matrices, or edge lists) based on the corresponding problem statement. For more detailed instructions and example outputs, see the `README.md` file inside each `questionX` directory.
